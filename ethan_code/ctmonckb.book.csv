"he was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantã¨s was beloved by them",0.735297441482544

"âbut,â replied the owner, glancing after dantã¨s, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, âit seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, danglars, to understand his business, for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone",0.41475433111190796

"father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow dantã¨s, who, after having traversed la canebiã¨re, took the rue de noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the allã©es de meilhan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room",0.5326254963874817

"â is not this true, fernand ? â âyes, that is very true, mercã©dã¨s,â replied the young man, âyes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry ? â 0045m âyou mistake, fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, i pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor",0.6257919073104858
"â fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercã©dã¨s, although for each of these tears he would have shed his heartâs blood; but these tears flowed for another",0.37988895177841187

"âand should any misfortune occur to you, dear edmond,â she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought, âif misfortune should occur to you, i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it",0.6371774673461914

"âwhy, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily ! â fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his hands, his elbows leaning on the table",0.2872997224330902
"âah, you see, danglars,â said caderousse, winking at his friend, âthis is how it is; fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave catalan, one of the best fishermen in marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named mercã©dã¨s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon ; and as the pharaon arrived todayâwhy, you understand ! â âno; i do not understand,â said danglars",0.9388307332992554

"âno, but it will be,â said caderousse, âas surely as dantã¨s will be captain of the pharaon âeh, danglars ? â danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness",0.15718579292297363
"âwell,â said he, filling the glasses, âlet us drink to captain edmond dantã¨s, husband of the beautiful catalane ! â caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp",0.4833179712295532

"absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and mercã©dã¨s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone",0.44938746094703674
"â 0056m âyes; but one gets out of prison,â said caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, âand when one gets out and oneâs name is edmond dantã¨s, one seeks revengeâââ âwhat matters that ? â muttered fernand",0.3915255665779114

"villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no doubt, dantã¨sâ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleonâs return",0.553080141544342
"the petition finished, villefort read it aloud",0.5785416960716248
"â and, sitting down, villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom",0.520311713218689
"twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand, and twice had villefort soothed him with promises",0.4709937572479248
"danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantã¨s; and, when napoleon returned to france, he, after the manner of mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, a decree of providence",0.2627544701099396
fernand understood nothing except that dantã¨s was absent,0.41564321517944336
"but fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes",0.5083243250846863
"fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry mercã©dã¨s",0.39278507232666016

villefort,0.5008293390274048
villefort is no longer at marseilles; he is now at toulouse,0.4281829297542572
"de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you ? â ânone; on the contrary, he was very kind to me",0.30395567417144775
"the inspector kept his word with dantã¨s; he examined the register, and found the following note concerning him: edmond dantã¨s: violent bonapartist; took an active part in the return from elba",0.5651562213897705
"this horrible place contained fifty cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell, and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantã¨sâhe was now number 34",0.1392470896244049
"then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene, mene, tekel upharsin of belshazzar",0.3762456178665161
edmond found some solace in these ideas,0.5590754151344299
edmond hoped he was dying,0.43226903676986694
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-oâ-the-wisps that play about the marshes,0.20231086015701294
"it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death ! suddenly, about nine oâclock in the evening, edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying",0.43100348114967346
"so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, edmond raised his head and listened",0.2607635259628296
"no, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death ! edmond still heard the sound",0.4574725329875946
edmond was intensely interested,0.5483893156051636
"for a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments",0.49545612931251526
"edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct",0.6051349639892578
"edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and returned to his couchâhe did not wish to die",0.3468860983848572
"â edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came",0.4157397150993347
"edmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound was heard from the wallâall was silent there",0.35495251417160034
"full of hope, edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and, thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh recovered",0.4425365626811981
"âit is a prisoner,â said edmond joyfully",0.5907847881317139
edmond did not close his eyes,0.5015785694122314
"encouraged by this discovery, edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer",0.4099871814250946
"edmond had all the night to work in, but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day",0.5539074540138245
"â edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a prisonerâhe is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron",0.38891392946243286
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths,0.4049406945705414
"the abbã© sank upon edmondâs bed, while edmond himself remained standing",0.4592961370944977
"â dantã¨s paused a moment, then said, âthis is it, word for word: âthe kingâs attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one edmond dantã¨s, mate on board the pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna, after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo, has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris",0.6341001987457275

"danglars was joking in a friendly way, but fernand looked pale and agitated",0.4410652220249176
"â ânoirtier ! â repeated the abbã©; ânoirtier ! âi knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria,âa noirtier, who had been a girondin during the revolution ! what was your deputy called ? â âde villefort ! â the abbã© burst into a fit of laughter, while dantã¨s gazed on him in utter astonishment",0.3328667879104614
"starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, âhis father ! his father ! â âyes, his father,â replied the abbã©; âhis right name was noirtier de villefort",0.6789282560348511
"the change that had come over villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,âall returned with a stunning force to his memory",0.7434664964675903
"edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result",0.40743792057037354
"with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and faria had been equally silent",0.36849167943000793
"â âalas,â murmured edmond to himself, âthis is a terrible relapse ! there was only this blow wanting",0.21255171298980713
"â âon the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, edmond ! â replied the old man",0.6146029829978943
â edmond turned away his head with a sigh,0.34846392273902893
"edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm",0.19197803735733032
"edmond was obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantã¨sâ chamber",0.25123393535614014
"â edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he seated himself on the stool beside him",0.5224475264549255
"âand now,â said the abbã©, âread this other paper;â and he presented to dantã¨s a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which edmond read as follows: â",0.5869013071060181
â edmond thought he was in a dreamâhe wavered between incredulity and joy,0.5926514863967896
"but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when faria was left alone, and when edmond returned to his cell",0.7677328586578369
"one night edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him",0.403020977973938
"âalas, my dear friend,â said faria in a resigned tone, âyou understand, do you not, and i need not attempt to explain to you ? â edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, âhelp, help ! â faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him",0.4839928448200226
"â edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, âoh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus ! â and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, âoh, i have saved you once, and i will save you a second time ! â and raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor",0.8164849281311035
"â edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed",0.47875648736953735
"half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period of anguish, edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heartâs pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed",0.6459526419639587
"edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead manâs face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did not recover, they sent for the doctor",0.4211385250091553
"â edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was said",0.3512551486492157
no longer could edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed,0.44496336579322815
"edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins",0.6283330917358398
"edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs",0.39839357137680054
âwhat can he be looking for ? â thought edmond,0.46205756068229675
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder,0.40869900584220886
"edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray",0.547379195690155
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted,0.5710443258285522
"he renewed against danglars, fernand, and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon",0.42381781339645386
"edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to âpumpâ him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta, which he knew as well as marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story",0.473972350358963
"here edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years",0.2954809069633484
"when the operation was concluded, and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass",0.25083285570144653
"edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friendâif, indeed, he had any friend leftâcould recognize him; he could not recognize himself",0.5117412805557251
"the master of la jeune amã©lie , who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmondâs value, had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits, which edmond had accepted",0.618791401386261
"it was in this costume, and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned",0.4730949103832245
"they sailed; edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison",0.42544665932655334
"0285m evening came, and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own, for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck",0.7605729103088379
"fortunately, as we have said, edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women, the wound soon closed",0.4348914623260498
"edmond then resolved to try jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but jacopo refused it indignantly",0.42894256114959717
"but this sufficed for jacopo, who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of positionâa superiority which edmond had concealed from all others",0.49557650089263916
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman,0.6469457149505615
"and when jacopo inquired of him, âwhat is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me ? â edmond replied, âwho knows ? you may one day be the captain of a vessel",0.5368165969848633
"two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other",0.6167259812355042
"prison had made edmond prudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever",0.2977752685546875
"he saw in the young man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance",0.5794285535812378
"edmond resigned the lugger to the masterâs care, and went and lay down in his hammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a moment",0.46621525287628174
"edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes",0.854209840297699
"never did a gamester, whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope",0.6130571961402893
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows,0.5409379005432129
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were,0.30856776237487793
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes,0.4346920847892761
"edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps",0.45710209012031555
"just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and they fired the signal agreed upon",0.4731607437133789
"they all rushed towards him, for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority; yet jacopo reached him first",0.5386441946029663
"he found edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless",0.3584396243095398
"edmond opened his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe pains in his loins",0.4949020743370056
all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock,0.440692663192749
"edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale",0.48290979862213135
"the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a cordial farewell, to which edmond replied with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body",0.547905683517456
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag,0.42265796661376953
"in a word, the island was inhabited, yet edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of god",0.5593374371528625
"this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed round in every direction",0.6418678760528564
"it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just set sail, that edmond fixed his eyes",0.46248146891593933
"edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto",0.45507243275642395
0307m edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him,0.4521397352218628
"in the first, blazed piles of golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold, which possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell on one another, sounded like hail against glass",0.266353040933609
"after having touched, felt, examined these treasures, edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock, from whence he could behold the sea",0.29414302110671997
"0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island; but as la jeune amã©lie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to leghorn",0.2825946509838104
"the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amã©lie having expired, dantã¨s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further",0.4625098407268524
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowâwho had been one of his own sailorsâas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance,0.5455945730209351
"the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son",0.43733376264572144
"as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire",0.5300121903419495
"â âwhat proofs do you require ? â âdid you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor named dantã¨s ? â âdantã¨s ? did i know poor dear edmond ? why, edmond dantã¨s and myself were intimate friends ! â exclaimed caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbã© fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny",0.35507631301879883

"morrel went away, making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctorâs order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery, and saying to mercã©dã¨s, âif you ever see my edmond again, tell him i die blessing him",0.43177035450935364

the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same,0.5431544184684753

"âfine spoil, captain, fine spoil ! â said peppino in italian, and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place",0.5193377137184143
"â from their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cã¦sarâs commentaries , and by danglars studying the life of alexander",0.5383793115615845

"he had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars",0.3088313341140747
"âah, ha,â cried danglars, âthis fellow is more like an ogre than anything else; however, i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating ! â we see that danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring voraciously",0.46787029504776
"danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, âmonsieur deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today",0.6062738299369812
"danglars knew that he was heard, so he redoubled his blows",0.39028674364089966

âhow much ? â asked danglars,0.46509113907814026

"â danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed it",0.4469815790653229
â danglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost,0.5325353145599365
